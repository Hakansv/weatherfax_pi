Weather Fax Plugin for OpenCPN
=======================================
Implement weather fax ability for opencpn.  This includes retrieval via sound card (radio fax) as well as the internet, or local image files.

Compiling
=========

* git clone git://github.com/seandepagnier/weatherfax_pi.git

Under windows, you must find the file "opencpn.lib" (Visual Studio) or "libopencpn.dll.a" (mingw) which is built in the build directory after compiling opencpn.  This file must be copied to the plugin directory.

Also for windows, you must download the curl library files.
For visual studio, extract this into the buildwin directory:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencpnplugins/files/weatherfax_pi/wf_depends.7z/download

For Mingw, only a single file is needed:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencpnplugins/files/weatherfax_pi/libcurl.dll/download

Under other operating systems the libcurl4-dev (libcurl4-gnutls-dev) package should be installed.

Build as normally:

* cd ..
* cd build
* cmake ..
* make
* make install
