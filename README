Weather Fax Plugin for OpenCPN
=======================================
Implement weather fax ability for opencpn.  This includes retrieval via sound card (radio fax) as well as the internet, or local image files.

Compiling
=========

Normally the libcurl4-dev (libcurl4-gnutls-dev) package should be installed, for Windows operating system, see below

* git clone git://github.com/seandepagnier/weatherfax_pi.git

Build as normally:

* cd ..
* cd build
* cmake ..
* make
* make install

Windows Specific Libraries
==========================

Under windows, you must find the file "opencpn.lib" (Visual Studio) or "libopencpn.dll.a" (mingw) which is built in the build directory after compiling opencpn.  This file must be copied to the plugin directory.

There are also some libraries and an external program needed:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencpnplugins/files/weatherfax_pi/wf_depends.7z/download

For Mingw, only a single file "libcurl.dll" is needed for libcurl, for visual studio, several files.
